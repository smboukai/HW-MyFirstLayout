                <p> I like science. I also like design. So now, I am a UX designer for medical devices. Call me, beep me if you want to reach me for any of your usability concerns.

            <h2> Here's My Approach</h2>
            <p> When it comes to design, I really focus on the end user. I'm trained in usability, specifically for medical devices. What does that have anything to do with design? Well, its simple. Because Clincians have to work with multiple technologies, read and analyize pages upon pages of information, and make quick, life-saving decisions, more often then not, they don't have time to figure out how to interact with all the UIs. When they need information, they need it fast, and there is no room for mistakes or delays. Taking that into account, I focus on what the user needs to see. I've found that when these questions are analyzed and accounted for early on, the design process becomes much more streamlined. </p>

                <h2>One of My Projects</h2>
                <p> Our team focused on designing a new feature, while redesigning certain DoorDash delivery interfaces from multiple standpoints. We created a new feature that would allow consumers to save at least 50% off their delivery fees, allowing DoorDash to plan more efficient routes & less cancelled orders for the driver.
